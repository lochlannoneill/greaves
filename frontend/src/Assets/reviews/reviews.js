    description: "Wow, this top is one of the softest tops I've ever owned, it really feels so lovely on.It's quite lightweight so won't keep you very warm but is stylish,I love the unusual sleeves however, I'm quite tall (5'9), and found the sleeves short.For reference I wear a 10-12 in tops but got the S as didn't want it to be too baggy, there is loads of stretch so I'm happy with the size, actually wish it was a bit more slim fitting.",

      "This jumper is lovely and soft and feels warm when worn without being too bulky. It can be worn on smart casual occasions and it looks stylish with the button detail on the v neckline it has a slight ribbed effect. I found the sleeve length perfect and body length was not too long just sat nicely on my hips. I got the black which looked smart worn with black trousers or jeans and the size s fitted very well I’m usually a size 10 . I would consider buying in a different colour as there is a good selection.",
